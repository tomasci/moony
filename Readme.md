> Disclaimer: This project is developed on macOS and tested on macOS. All instructions are for that system only, although the project and commands may work on any other system. Support will be improved later.

> If you want to help me or see me doing something wrong in terms of Go (or anything else), please contact me or create a PR, I'd appreciate it, thanks! P.S. I'm new to Go lang.

### Requirements

1. Install Go 1.23
2. Install reflex (`go install github.com/cespare/reflex@latest`)

> The project will probably work on any other version of Go, but it was originally created in version 1.23

---

### Load shell

1. Open project root in terminal
2. Run command: `source shell.sh`
3. Run `moony:help` to display all commands

> Shell will also update chmod for scripts in scripts folder, you can remove this part if you don't want to

---

### Basic testing

1. open terminal
2. open udp connection using netcat `nc -u <ip> <port>`

> By default, server runs on 0.0.0.0:25505 â€“ all available networks 

Start sending messages and you will see them in the server logs

### Issues

**Reflex command not found (`zsh: command not found: reflex`)**

* open your terminal and run `ls $HOME/go/bin/reflex` to check if reflex is installed 
* if it is installed run `open ~/.zprofile` or `~/.zshrc` to open your shell configuration 
* your shell config may have different name
* add these lines to your config

```
# go path
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"
```

### Other

Please, if you ever decide to create a Pull Request (PR), review all the code in the repository first. I prefer to have a comment to almost every line, sometimes the comments describe how things work, sometimes the idea behind the code, etc. Why? First, it's how I learn. Second, after a long time, when I go back, I can more quickly read and understand what's going on. And also, I think it can be helpful for anyone who ever tries to modify code. So, please comment your code and thank you.
