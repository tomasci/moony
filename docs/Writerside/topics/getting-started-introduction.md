> Please, if you ever decide to create a Pull Request (PR), 
> review all the code in the repository first. 
> I prefer to have a comment to almost every line, 
> sometimes the comments describe how things work, 
> sometimes the idea behind the code, etc. 
> Why? First, it's how I learn. 
> Second, after a long time, when I go back, 
> I can more quickly read and understand what's going on. 
> And also, I think it can be helpful for anyone who ever tries to modify code. 
> So, please comment your code and thank you.
